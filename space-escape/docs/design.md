### Mechanics  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a71e99b-ad78-4085-97ad-7ed90745156a)

- **Endless Running:** The player character automatically moves forward, creating a constant sense of momentum. The scrolling background enhances the feeling of speed and progression as the player races to survive.  
- **Enemy Encounters:** Enemies spawn from the right side of the screen and move toward the player. Players must time jumps to avoid enemies, while attempting to collect coins and items.
- **Power-Ups and Collectibles:**  
  - **Coins:** Increases the player's score and encourages risky maneuvers to collect them.  
  - **Health Packs:** Restores health lost to enemy attacks.  
  - **Ammo Pickups:** Allows the player to fire their gun, eliminating enemies for additional score points.  
- **Dynamic Difficulty:**  
  - **Level 1:** Slow-moving enemies, frequent item spawns, and longer gaps between enemy waves for teaching new players the mechanics.  
  - **Level 2:** Enemies move faster, spawn more frequently, and items become less common, raising the challenge.  
  - **Level 3 (Endless Mode):** Enemies spawn at varying speeds and rhythms, forcing the player to adapt quickly and manage their ammo carefully. Fewer items spawn, while enemies arrive in unpredictable patterns to keep players on their toes.
- **Score Tracking:**  
  - Level 3, the endless mode, tracks player's scores. When a player reaches a game over, the player's score from the run is displayed and the best high-score on record is displayed. if the layer has beaten the hiigh-score, their score will replace it.

### Additional Challenges  
- **Friendly NPCs:** Friendly warrior characters occasionally appear on the battlefield. Shooting them reduces the player’s score, keeping player's on their toes, increasing variance in the npc behaviours, and discouraging being too liberal with the gun.  
- **Score System:** Endless Mode tracks high scores, allowing players to challenge themselves and compete with friends for bragging rights.
