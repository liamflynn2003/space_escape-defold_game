      * Visuals of the game world
    * Characters
      * Details of the characters, their backstory, motivation, and personality if applicable
      * Include visuals about the character
    * Mobile Game Design
      * Outline how a game is designed for mobile in general, not your specific game
      * Compare the guidelines for mobile game development to your game and highlight where you are following the guidelines and where you are not
      * Suggest ways to make the game more suitable for the mobile market
    * Monetisation
        * Outline how the game could be monetised
    * Distribution
        * Outline how the game could be distributed for the mobile market, include mainstream and alternative (indie) distribution methods
* It should be written in markdown format and should be in a file called `docs/design.md`
* Should not be written in the first or second person, and they should not contain vague terms (e.g. “a head shot will result in ‘significant’ damage”).  Aspirational writing should not be used (e.g. hopefully the drawbridge animation will point the player in the right direction). Write in a technical style, in other words be concise, precise, direct, and well organised.
* Grading will be based on the level of detail, the quality of the writing, and the overall presentation of the document from Starter to Excellent.
